# MinecraftServerWebsite
A website for the NDN 2019 Summer Minecraft server!

## Setup for development
The NDN Minecraft website is built with a [node.js] (https://nodejs.org/en/) server and [ReactJS] (https://reactjs.org/) for front end rendering. The project also makes use of [ReactRouter] (https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-router) and [ReactBootstrap] (https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-bootstrap).

In order to setup for development, clone the repo and make sure you have [node.js] (https://nodejs.org/en/) installed with npm configured. Open the folder entitled `mc-server-website` and run `npm install`. That's it! You're all setup for development!

Run `npm start` in order to start the development server! ðŸŽ‰
